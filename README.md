# Solution

My solution to the following problem:

>Welcome to Number Associative Mining and Trading Inc, or NAMT for short! Your duties are to make sure our turtles, working in difficult environments, are making correct associations, and stopping their operations when the tunnel is about to crumble. For that, our mathematicians finally found with absolute certainty the pattern the numbers mined follow before going too far.

The Problem:
 >The first 100 numbers of the mine are always secure, but after that, the next number is only safe if it is the sum of 2 numbers in the previous 100. 

## Description

I used both Vector and Hashmap for this challenge to reduce time complexity.

Vector allows me to ratain order of numbers adn easily pop the first index

Hashmap allows me to easily search if desired number is in the last 100 with skipping duplicates.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `cargo build` to build the project
3. Run `cargo run` to run the project
